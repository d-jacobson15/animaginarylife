# Chapter 1

WHEN I FIRST saw the child I cannot say. I see myself – I might be three or four  
years old – playing under the olives at the edge of our farm, just within call of  
the goatherd, and I am talking to the child, whether for the first time or not I  
cannot tell at this distance. The goatherd is dozing against an olive bole, his  
head rolled back to show the dark line of his jaw, <span class="annotation" data-annotation="An interesting description of the goatherd's posture and the rugged countryside.">and the sinews of his scraggy neck</span>, the black mouth gaping. Bees shift amongst the herbs.

The air glitters. It must be late summer. <span class="annotation" data-annotation="Poppies are known for their vibrant color and short lifespan—symbolic in many cultures.">There are windblown poppies in the grass.</span>  
A black he-goat is up on his hind legs reaching for vineshoots. The child is there.

... (and so on) ...
